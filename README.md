## Purpose of the Project

To try real interaction in a team using the example of creating a joint project using a task board and GitHub sharing tools.
The central focus of this Project is on the team dynamics and collaborative efforts that contributed to the project's success, rather than merely the project's technical aspects.

## Technology Stack 💻📚

The decision on whether to use a framework for the project was hard for us because we don't have experience with framework. We decided to try React ⚛️, but we have the option to proceed without a framework too.

1. TypeScript is mandatory for this project. It ensures type safety and improve the maintainability and scalability of the application 📘.
2. The application is a Single Page Application (SPA) with an empty index.html 🗂️.
3. Our application have its own unique data set to enhance uniqueness and provide a novel user experience. 🚫📊💡
4. We use Vite for the project.
5. We also use ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Jest for testing.
